Help Neighbor-Bad Seeds

Bad seeds is a Python terminal game, a "episode" of the future series game "Help Neighbor", wich runs in the Codeinstitute mock terminal on Heroko.
It's time to help each other instead of killiing or destroy. Future series could be "Help Ocean", "Help Forest", "Help Mankind", etc.

In this game, player and the neighbor (computer) will help each other to dig out the bad seeds in their garden. Each seed occupies one square on the board.

Here is the live version of my project.
